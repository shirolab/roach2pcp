 #   69  * UDP packet structure:
 # 70  * -----------------------
 # 71  * Total length: 8234 bytes
 # 72  * Header: 42 bytes
 # 73  * Data + timing info: 8192 bytes
 # 74  * Data type: 32b signed integers
 # 75  *     - Data should be unpacked as little-endian
 # 76  * Number of channels: 1016
 # 77  *     - Each channel has a 32b I value, and a 32b Q value
 # 78  * Values:
 # 79  * 1 - 512: Channels 0 - 512, I values
 # 80  * 513 - 1024: Channels 0 - 512, Q values
 # 81  * 1025 - 1536: Channels 513 - 1024, I values
 # 82  * 1537 - 2048: Channels 513 - 1024, Q values
 # 83  *
 # 84  * Note: There are technically 1024 data channels,
 # 85  * but the last 20 bytes of the packet
 # 86  * are used to store timing information, limiting the number
 # 87  * of useable channels to 1012
 # 88  *
 # 89  * The information stored in the last 20 bytes:
 # 90  *     - Should be unpacked as BIG-endian, unsigned
 # 91  *     - Consists of five 32b unsigned ints
 # 92  *     - From end of packet, these are:
 #       * Packet info /* 32b register for arbitrary info to be saved into udp packet before transmission. */
 # 93  * Raw packet count /* Initialized to 0 with 'GbE_pps_start' */
 # 94  * Fine timestamp /* Clock cycles elapsed since last PPS pulse */
 # 95  * Course timestamp /* The number of PPS pulses elapsed since 'pps_start' */
 # 96  * Data checksum /* Currently a constant placeholder, 42 (in progress) */
 # 97  *
