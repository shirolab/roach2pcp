Readme file for the new Python Roach control software for large arrays of kinetic inductance detectors. 

This code is basically a re-factoring of the original python scripts written by Sam Gordon (ASU) and Sam Rowe (Cardiff) to interface to the Roach systems. The aim of this work is to develop a set of software routines suitable for taking on-sky data at the telescope. To that end, improvements over the current software will target highly reliable, well documented code with detailed logging implementations and on-the-fly debugging capabilities. 

Most of the code of the individual functions is borrowed from the original code. The major difference is the structuring, and implementation of support for multiple roach subsystems.
