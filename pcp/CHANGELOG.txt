commit 2d4a259596e2c836f65e70b77174b004c8551a44

    finished synth devices and sources for independent control of single/multi port synths.
    
    Using Thomas's updated windfreaksynth_v2 we now have separate classes for synthesiser hardware devices and synthesiser sources for muscat. The lib_hardware.intiialise_connected_synths function returns a dict of the synth *sources* relating to the devices and their channels as named in the hardware_config.cfg and roach_config.cfg files, and no manual source switching is required. This did require adding synth devices and synth sources for all synths in the synthclasses submodule, including the dummy synth but should be fully backwards compatible with rest of the PCP code.


2018-12-11 14:14 [SR] ==================

Synth stuff:
- Set up synth instantiation based on physcial devices (dummy synth is still physical)
- Multi-source synths now share a common instance
- Windfreak set up to use CLK on channel0 and LO on channel1 (muscat requirement)
- RoachInterface now sets the CLK source to 512 Mhz before loading any firmware

FPGA stuff:
- RoachInterface uploads firmware if the currently running firmware does not match.
- RoachInterface performs QDR calibration only when uploading firmware
- QDR calibration actually runs now.
- libFPGA.configure_downlink_registers now converts ip_addr strings to integers

- Added this file.


2018-12-07 12:30 [PB] ==================

- Removed device_id field in the network_config file, that is what the field names (i.e. network_config.keys()) are for…
	- if there is a good reason to keep it, let me know and i’ll add it back in (edited)

- Added a maxchannels field for each roach to the roach_config file to retain flexibility
	- Modified the configuration verification accordingly
