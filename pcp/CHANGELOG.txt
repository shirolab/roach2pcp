2018-12-11 14:14 [SR] ==================

Synth stuff:
- Set up synth instantiation based on physcial devices (dummy synth is still physical)
- Multi-source synths now share a common instance
- Windfreak set up to use CLK on channel0 and LO on channel1 (muscat requirement)
- RoachInterface now sets the CLK source to 512 Mhz before loading any firmware

FPGA stuff:
- RoachInterface uploads firmware if the currently running firmware does not match.
- RoachInterface performs QDR calibration only when uploading firmware
- QDR calibration actually runs now.
- libFPGA.configure_downlink_registers now converts ip_addr strings to integers

2018-12-07 12:30 [PB] ==================

- Removed device_id field in the network_config file, that is what the field names (i.e. network_config.keys()) are for…
	- if there is a good reason to keep it, let me know and i’ll add it back in (edited)

- Added a maxchannels field for each roach to the roach_config file to retain flexibility
	- Modified the configuration verification accordingly
